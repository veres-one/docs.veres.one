# Veres One Elector Agreement Overview

The Veres One Elector Agreement is designed to ensure that a healthy
ecosystem of active Electors exist for the Veres One Network and that
all participants critical to the operation of the Network are properly funded.
Learn more about the Electors
[here](/network/nodes/#electors).

There are a number of goals that the Elector Agreement is designed to
achieve:

 * The Elector is a self-directed individual or organization that is granted
   the limited privilege to participate in the creation of blocks on the
   Network by the Veres One Project
   [Board of Governors](/network/governors/).
 * Electors that destabilize the network are easily detected and their
   privileges on the network are revoked by the
   [Board of Governors](/network/governors/).
 * Electors are paid for the services they provide as based on
   the [funding model](/network/funding) set by the Board of Governors.
 * Communication between the Board of Governors and the Electors must be
   done publicly, with minor exceptions when dealing with extremely sensitive
   security or legal issues.

supervise or inspect the work as it progresses in order to ensure compliance
with the terms of the contract or (2) the
Veres One Project has or retains the right to revoke the Elector's
credentials on the Network and thus it's limited ability to create
blocks on the network if it is in violation of this Agreement.

has an obligation to notify any involved parties that it is not an agent of the
Veres One Project.

for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and
enforceable. If a court finds that any provision of this Agreement is invalid

and enforced as so limited.
