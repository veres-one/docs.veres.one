                <h1 id="veres-one-maintainer-agreement-overview">Veres One Maintainer Agreement Overview</h1>
<p>The Veres One Maintainer Agreement is designed to ensure that the organization
charged with maintaining the Veres One technology platform does so in a way that
supports the communities that depend on the ledger as directed by
The Board of Governors.</p>
<p>There are a number of goals that the maintainer agreement is designed to
achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Maintainer is a self-directed organization that is expected to
   uphold the Veres One Mission, ensure the technical correctness of the
   Veres One ledger software, and support the proper operation of the network.</li>
<li>If the current Maintainer fails to uphold its duties, it may be replaced
   by another more capable organization at the discretion of the
   Board of Governors.</li>
<li>The Maintainer may make as much as a 20% profit, but is expected to keep
   costs low in order to ensure the long-term cost effectiveness of the
   Veres One ledger.</li>
<li>Communication between the Board of Governors and the Maintainer must be
   done publicly, with minor exceptions when dealing with extremely sensitive
   security or legal issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-warranty">GENERAL WARRANTY</h2>
<p>Maintainer shall provide its services and
meet its obligations under this Contract in a timely and workmanlike
manner, using knowledge and recommendations for performing the services
which meet generally acceptable standards in Maintainer's
community and region, and will provide a standard of care equal to, or
superior to, care used by service providers similar to Veres One
Maintainer on similar projects. Service Provider shall not be liable for
any delay in performance directly or indirectly resulting from acts of
Service Recipient, its agents, employees, or subcontractors.</p>
<h2 id="default">DEFAULT</h2>
<p>The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a

<p>b.    The insolvency or bankruptcy of either party.</p>
<p>c.    The subjection of any of either party's property to any levy,

and manner provided for in this Contract.</p>
<p>e.    The occurrence of a default on the part of the Service Recipient of
the Contract pursuant to which Service Recipient obtained the
Software.</p>
<h2 id="remedies">REMEDIES</h2>
<p>In addition to any and all other rights a party may have
available according to law, if a party defaults by failing to
substantially perform any provision, term or condition of this Contract
(including without limitation the failure to make a monetary payment when
due), the other party may terminate the Contract by providing written
notice to the defaulting party. This notice shall describe with sufficient
detail the nature of the default. The party receiving such notice shall
have 90 days from the effective date of such notice to cure the
default(s). Unless waived by a party providing notice, the failure to cure
the default(s) within such time period shall result in the automatic
termination of this Contract.</p>
<h2 id="force-majeure">FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
<p>If performance of this Contract or any obligation under
this Contract is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by causes
beyond either party's reasonable control ("Force Majeure"), and if the
party unable to carry out its obligations gives the other party prompt
written notice of such event, then the obligations of the party invoking
this provision shall be suspended to the extent necessary by such event.
The term Force Majeure shall include, without limitation, acts of God,
fire, explosion, vandalism, storm or other similar occurrence, orders or
acts of military or civil authority, or by national emergencies,
insurrections, riots, or wars, or strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages, or
other labor disputes, or supplier failures. The excused party shall use
reasonable efforts under the circumstances to avoid or remove such causes
of non-performance and shall proceed to perform with reasonable dispatch
whenever such causes are removed or ceased. An act or omission shall be
deemed within the reasonable control of a party if committed, omitted, or
caused by such party, or its employees, officers, agents, or
affiliates.</p>
<h2 id="arbitration">ARBITRATION</h2>
<p>Any controversies or disputes arising out of or relating
to this Contract shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance
with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The parties shall select a mutually acceptable
arbitrator knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject matter of
this Contract. In the event the parties are unable to agree to such a
selection, each party will select an arbitrator and the two arbitrators in
turn shall select a third arbitrator, all three of whom shall preside
jointly over the matter. The arbitration shall take place at a location
that is reasonably centrally located between the parties, or otherwise
mutually agreed upon by the parties. All documents, materials, and
information in the possession of each party that are in any way relevant
to the dispute shall be made available to the other party for review and
copying no later than 30 days after the notice of arbitration is served.
The arbitrator(s) shall not have the authority to modify any provision of
this Contract or to award punitive damages. The arbitrator(s) shall have
the power to issue mandatory orders and restraint orders in connection
with the arbitration. The decision rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be
final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in
conformity with the decision in any court having jurisdiction. The
agreement to arbitration shall be specifically enforceable under the
prevailing arbitration law. During the continuance of any arbitration
proceeding, the parties shall continue to perform their respective
obligations under this Contract.</p>
<h2 id="entire-agreement">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>This Contract contains the entire agreement of the

agreement whether oral or written concerning the subject matter of this
Contract. This Contract supersedes any prior written or oral agreements
between the parties.</p>
<h2 id="notice">NOTICE</h2>
<p>Any notice or communication required or permitted under this
Contract shall be sufficiently given if delivered in person or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address set forth in the
opening paragraph or to such other address as one party may have furnished
to the other in writing.</p>
<h2 id="waiver-of-contractual-right">WAIVER OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHT</h2>
