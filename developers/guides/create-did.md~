This quick Developer Guide will walk you through creating a decentralized
identifier using command line tools.

## Requirements

## Install did-client

Install the Decentralized Identifier client by running the following command:

```
> mkdir did-client
> cd did-client
> npm install did-client
```

## Generate a Decentralized Identifier

Generate a Decentralized Identifier on the Veres One Testnet by running the
following command:
