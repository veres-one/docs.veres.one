# The Veres One Maintainer

The Veres One Maintainer is an organization that is hired by the
Veres One Project's Board of Governors on behalf of the Veres One Network to
maintain the
[Veres One Software](https://github.com/veres-one/). Services provided by
the Maintainer include continuous security review (and 3rd party audits),
managing community contributions, correcting software defects, and
implementing new features identified by the Network participants or
the Board of Governors.

## What is a Maintainer?

Governance and proper incentives is a critical part of creating a
global public utility. For this reason the Maintainer
of the blockchain and the Veres One Project are
distinctly separate organizations that don't share employees or have any
financial ties. This separation ensures there is no conflict of interest
at play in the governance of the Veres One Network. 

You can read more on the [Veres One Governance](governance.md) page.

## Becoming the Maintainer

The Maintainer, and its employees, are chosen based on technical competence,
a proven track record of contributing to and providing critical fixes to
the Veres One software, and providing a competitive market rate for the
services provided.

The contract that the Maintainer must agree to when selected is covered
under the [Veres One Maintainer Agreement](../agreements/maintainer.md).

## Interacting with the Maintainer

The primary mechanism of interacting with the Maintainer are by logging
issues in the [Veres One Software](https://github.com/veres-one/) repositories,
the [Veres One Project public mailing list](https://github.com/veres-one/), and
the regular held Veres One teleconferences, which are announced on the public
mailing list.
