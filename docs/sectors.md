# Veres One Sectors and Applications

Veres One is well-suited for industries with strong requirements
surrounding identifiers and identities.

## Government

Governments may issue digital identifications such as driverâ€™s licenses,
passports, metro passes, food stamp vouchers, or voting IDs. Credentials
are issued directly to citizens, enabling them to decide with whom the
credentials are shared.

## Healthcare

Veres One provides a common platform on which disparate entities within the
healthcare system interact with high assurance. Physician licenses,
digital prescriptions, and medical records are some examples of identity
data that can be verified.

## Financial Services

Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions benefit from
stronger identity verification and cost-effective know-your-customer
checks. This reduces fraud and eases regulatory compliance.

## Humanitarian

Over one billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity. This
restricts their access to financial services, education, and healthcare. By
providing underserved individuals with a Veres One identifier, developing
countries and service organizations can coordinate outreach and aid.

## Trade

Every trade entity in a complex economy can be more strongly authenticated,
reducing fraud, friction, and transit time across supply chains.

## Social

Decentralized social networks, peer-to-peer messaging apps, and sharing economy
apps benefit from Veres One features such as user centricity and data portability.
