# Governance of the Veres One Network

All technologies have a socio-political aspect which, if ignored, can have
negative repercussions on the Network and society. With this in mind, the
governance around the Veres One Network is designed to carefully balance the
needs of all participants while ensuring the long-term viability of the Network
for decades to come.

There are five critical parties that help govern the Veres One
Network: the Veres One Community Group, the [Board of Governors](governors.md),
Advisory Committees, the [Nodes](nodes.md)
(aka Network participants), and the [Maintainer](maintainer.md).

The Veres One Community Group drives development through a multistakeholder
consensus driven process. The Board of Governors accept or reject Community
Group decisions based on whether the decisions are in line with the Veres One
Project's mission.

The Board of Governors have their powers checked by the Maintainer and the
Network participants. The Maintainer has its powers checked by the Board of
Governors and the Network participants. Implementation of new features that
affect the Network require the implicit approval of the Network participants,
and the explicit approval of both the Board of Governors and the Maintainer,
making it extremely difficult for any party to make permanent decisions in a
unilateral fashion.

All parties are held accountable by legal agreements.

## Decisions Making Process

The Veres One Project's decision making process is a simple three step
procedure:

1. *Introduction*: All proposals are introduced in the Veres One Community
   Group. A proposal may be made either on the mailing list or any public
   community group teleconference where the transcript of the proposal is
   sent to the mailing list.
2. *Consideration*: Proposals are debated in the Veres One Community Group
   until consensus has been achieved. Members of the Advisory Council and
   Board of Governors may provide input on a proposal during this time. An
   individual may determine whether or not consensus has been achieved by
   asking for "+1" replies of support or "-1" replies of opposition to the
   proposal. The proposer should attempt to resolve any "-1" replies as those
   may result in the Board of Governors determining that consensus has not
   been achieved.
3. *Ratification*: Once consensus has been achieved, the proposal is sent to
   the Veres One Board of Governors for an official vote of approval. The
   Board of Governors is expected to review the proposal to ensure consensus
   has been achieved and then pass the proposal unless it endangers the
   Veres One Mission. The final decision is determined by a simple
   majority vote.

### Community Group

The Veres One Community Group, housed at the W3C, directs the development
and management of the Veres One Blockchain.

Community Group decisions are made by consensus and sent to the Board of
Governors for review and voting. Consensus is not meant to mean unanimity
but "general agreement with very few principled objections". Members of
the Board of Governors vote to accept or reject Community Group decisions
based on whether consensus has been achieved and whether the proposal
supports the Veres One Mission. Meetings are open to the public and
transcripts are made available through the Veres One website. Anyone can
join the Veres One Community Group.

### Advisory Council

The Advisory Council is comprised of area experts that advise the Veres
One Community Group and the Board of Governors on technical, legal, and
community matters.

Unlike the Board of Governors, the Advisory Council, does not have
decision making authority and therefore may have business activities that
utilize the Veres One Blockchain. They are a part of the Veres One
Community Group and may support or oppose a proposal in that capacity.

### Board of Governors

The Board of Governors is responsible for ensuring the stability of the
socio-political and economic operation of the Veres One Network and for
safeguarding the Mission of the Veres One Foundation.

Decisions made by the Community Group must be approved by the Board of
Governors to take effect. If Community Group proposals are accepted by the
Board they are sent to Veres One Foundation staff to be implemented. If
proposals are rejected, Board members who reject proposals reply to the
community group with a justification for the rejection. In extreme cases,
if a Board member acts against the Veres One Mission, a proposal may be
presented to replace the Board member.

Board members may participate as Community Group members by engaging in
proposal deliberation and supporting or opposing proposals during the
Consideration phase. Board members can effectively wear two hats, one as a
Community Group member with a more personal opinion on specific issues and
the other as a member of the Board of Governors, who acts to protect the
Mission of the Veres One Project. A member of the Board of Governors can
speak to the negatives of a specific proposal while voting to pass said
proposal if it has consensus and does not undermine the Mission of the
Veres One Foundation.

## Nodes: Checks and Balances

People and organizations run Nodes which are compliant with the open standards
implemented by the Veres One Software. The software itself has
checks and balances built in, such as Proof of Work or Accelerator throttling
to limit Denial of Service attacks, so that no single Node may operate in
a way that is disruptively harmful to the Network.

Similarly, Nodes provide checks and balances against the Board of Governors and
the Maintainer by refusing to run software that does not take their needs and
preferences into account. The Nodes may fork the network if they decide to
run software with a different purpose in mind.

## Maintainer: Checks and Balances

The Maintainer is responsible for ensuring that the Veres One Software operates
according to the needs and preferences of the Network participants and the
Board of Governors.

Nodes provide checks and balances against the Maintainer by refusing to run
software that does not take their needs into account.

The Board of Governors provide checks and balances against the Maintainer by
being empowered to terminate the Maintainer's contract and hire a
replacement.

## Veres One Community Group: Checks and Balances

The W3C Veres One Community Group directs the development and management of
the Veres One Blockchain. Meetings are open to the public and minutes are
made available in a public github repository. Anyone
can [join the Community Group here](https://www.w3.org/community/veres-one/).

Participants include representatives of non-profit organizations interested
in privacy and self-administered identity management as well as for-profit
entities such as Accelerators who utilize the Veres One Blockchain to provide
services to customers.

Community Group decisions are made by consensus and sent
to the Board of Governors for review and voting. The Board of Governors will
vote to accept or reject Community Group decisions based on their compliance
with the Veres One Mission.

## Board of Governors: Checks and Balances

The Board of Governors is responsible for ensuring the stability of the
socio-political and economic operation of the Veres One Network.

Decisions made by the community group must be approved by the Board of
Governors to take effect.

Nodes provide checks and balances against the Board of Governors by refusing to
run software that does not take their needs into account.

The Maintainer provides checks and balances against the Board of Governors
by refusing to implement mandates in software that undermine the needs and
preferences of the Network participants or that would be otherwise disruptively
harmful to the Network.
