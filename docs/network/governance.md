# Governance of the Veres One Network

All technologies have a socio-political aspect which, if ignored, can have
negative repercussions on the Network and society. With this in mind, the
governance around the Veres One Network is designed to carefully balance the
needs of all participants while ensuring the long-term viability of the Network
for decades to come.

There are five critical parties that help govern the Veres One
Network: the Veres One Community Group, the [Board of Governors](governors.md),
Advisory Committees, the [Nodes](nodes.md)
(aka Network participants), and the [Maintainer](maintainer.md).

The Veres One Community Group drives development through a multistakeholder
consensus driven process. The Board of Governors accept or reject Community
Group decisions based on whether the decisions are in line with the Veres One
Project's mission.

The Board of Governors have their powers checked by the Maintainer and the
Network participants. The Maintainer has its powers checked by the Board of
Governors and the Network participants. Implementation of new features that
affect the Network require the implicit approval of the Network participants,
and the explicit approval of both the Board of Governors and the Maintainer,
making it extremely difficult for any party to make permanent decisions in a
unilateral fashion.

All parties are held accountable by legal agreements.

## Node Checks and Balances

People and organizations run Nodes which are compliant with the open standards
implemented by the Veres One Software. The software itself has
checks and balances built in, such as Proof of Work or Accelerator throttling
to limit Denial of Service attacks, so that no single Node may operate in
a way that is disruptively harmful to the Network.

Similarly, Nodes provide checks and balances against the Board of Governors and
the Maintainer by refusing to run software that does not take their needs and
preferences into account. The Nodes may fork the network if they decide to
run software with a different purpose in mind.

## Maintainer Checks and Balances

The Maintainer is responsible for ensuring that the Veres One Software operates
according to the needs and preferences of the Network participants and the
Board of Governors.

Nodes provide checks and balances against the Maintainer by refusing to run
software that does not take their needs into account.

The Board of Governors provide checks and balances against the Maintainer by
being empowered to terminate the Maintainer's contract and hire a
replacement.

## Veres One Community Group

The W3C Veres One Community Group directs the development and management of
the Veres One Blockchain. Meetings are open to the public and minutes are
made available in a public github repository. Anyone
can [join the Community Group here](https://www.w3.org/community/veres-one/).

Participants include representatives of non-profit organizations interested
in privacy and self-administered identity management as well as for-profit
entities such as Accelerators who utilize the Veres One Blockchain to provide
services to customers. Community Group decisions are made by consensus and sent
to the Board of Governors for review and voting.

## Board of Governors Checks and Balances

The Board of Governors is responsible for ensuring the stability of the
socio-political and economic operation of the Veres One Network.

Decisions made by the community group must be approved by the Board of
Governors to take effect.

Nodes provide checks and balances against the Board of Governors by refusing to
run software that does not take their needs into account.

The Maintainer provides checks and balances against the Board of Governors
by refusing to implement mandates in software that undermine the needs and
preferences of the Network participants or that would be otherwise disruptively
harmful to the Network.
