# The Veres One Network

The Veres One Network is a collection participants and consists of a number of
roles:

* **Entities** (people, organizations, and devices) use the Network to create
  and update decentralized identifiers and their associated metadata.
* **[Nodes](nodes.md)** are responsible for providing computational and
  storage resources for the Network. As the system is permissionless, any
  person or organization may run one or more Nodes.
* **[Accelerators](accelerators.md)** enable entities to increase the speed
  at which Entities can create and update identifiers on the Network.
* **[The Maintainer](maintainer.md)** is responsible for maintaining the
  Veres One software including continuous security review, managing community
  contributions, correcting software defects, and implementing new features.
* **[The Board of Governors](governors.md)** is responsible for governance.
  This includes ensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Project
  mission and managing, collecting, and distributing funds according to
  the funding model.
* **Veres One Community Group** The W3C Veres One Community Group directs
  the development and management of the Veres One Blockchain. Meetings are
  open to the public and minutes are made available in a public github
  repository. Community Group decisions are made by consensus and sent to the
  Board of Governors for review and
  voting. [Join the Community Group here.](https://www.w3.org/community/veres-one/)
* **Advisory Committees** are comprised of area experts that advise the Board
  of Governors and the Veres One Community Group on technical, legal, and
  community matters.
