# The Veres One Network

The Veres One Network is a collection participants and consists of a number of
roles:

* **Entities** (people, organizations, and devices) use the Network to create
  and update decentralized identifiers and their associated metadata.
* **[Nodes](nodes.md)** are responsible for providing computational and
  storage resources for the Network. As the system is permissionless, any
  person or organization may run one or more Nodes.
* **[Accelerators](accelerators.md)** enable entities to increase the speed
  at which Entities can create and update identifiers on the Network.
* **[The Maintainer](maintainer.md)** is responsible for maintaining the
  Veres One software including continuous security review, managing community
  contributions, correcting software defects, and implementing new features.
* **[The Board of Governors](governors.md)** is responsible for governance.
  This includes ensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Project
  mission and managing, collecting, and distributing funds according to
  the funding model.
* **Veres One Community Group** The Veres One Community Group will be run out
  of the W3C and will do most of the work directing development and management
  of the Veres One Blockchain. Anyone who cares to show up for
  Veres One Community Group meetings on a regular basis gets a say. Community
  Group decisions are made by consensus and sent to the Board of Governors for
  review. [Join the Community Group here.](https://www.w3.org/community/veres-one/)
* **Board of Advisors** are selected based on their notable skill set and
  experience in the identity space. Advisors provide support to the Board and
  Community Group when their specialty is needed. Advisors are grouped into
  committees to help the network participant identify Advisors that are best
  suited to provide input on a particular issue. Since Advisors don't have
  decision making authority they can have business activities that use the Veres
  One Network as there is no conflict of interest.
