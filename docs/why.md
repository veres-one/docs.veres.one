# Why Veres One?

Veres One architects have been involved with the creation of Verifiable
Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers from the beginning, having originated
many of the concepts. They have since been deeply engaged with maturing
these technologies in groups at the W3C and Rebooting Web of Trust communities.

Veres One is a fit-for purpose blockchain optimized for decentralized identifier
management. Its simplicity and tailored architecture result in a secure,
performant, and cost-effective identifier ledger.

## Cost-Effective

The fit-for-purpose nature of the Veres One Blockchain reduces computational
overhead, lowering the cost of creating and managing decentralized
identifiers when compared to popular blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The Veres One Network is a mission-driven organization, so costs can
be kept to a minimum. As the network grows, economies of scale will reduce
fees. The network deliberately uses no token currency in order to avoid
speculation, ensuring long-term cost predictability.

## Secure

The simplicity of the Veres One network means there is a decreased attack
surface, fewer bugs, and more flexibility for adaptation as the network evolves.

## Performant

Consensus throughput/transaction speeds

## Open

Veres One is based entirely on international web standards, open specifications,
and has an [ethical license](https://docs.veres.one/agreements/software/).

The Veres One Project will always strive to be 100% compliant with the standards
it uses and will help create new standards where none exist via the W3C and other
pertinent standards organizations.

Broad implementation and interoperability can only be achieved if all aspects of
the system are documented and standardized in a patent-free and royalty-free
manner while ensuring that the network is properly funded.

All Board Meetings are in the public domain.

## Self Administered Identity

Part of the Veres One mission is to provide an identity infrastructure that
maximizes autonomy, allowing entities to more fully manage how, when, and with
whom their identity information and data are shared.

To this end, Veres One helps any person or organization in the world create and
control their identifiers.

This approach enables use cases like patient centric health records and peer to
peer applications.

## Privacy Aware

Veres One is committed to allowing for maximum privacy. Different use cases
require different levels of privacy. The Veres One Project aims to enable the
entire spectrum of use cases and privacy levels and is itself agnostic on how
the Veres One network is utilized.

The architecture allows for implementations that reduce the amount of personal
data shared by enabling wallet holders to selective choose which credentials,
or even parts of credentials, are shared with whom.

Multiple identifiers enable users to create and compartmentalize different
profiles, such as personal, social, and professional profiles, in a way that
cannot be correlated.

The fact that Veres One is a tokenless network makes it more difficult to track
the exchange of identity information. However, the way an agent or digital
wallet provider manages your information plays a significant role in how your
privacy is preserved and how easily correlatable your activities are.

## Non-speculative

Unlike many other blockchain networks Veres One does not use a scarce network
token. This removes price volatility as well as regulatory risk.

The lack of a cryptocurrency, eliminates currency speculation and ensures
predictable long term operational costs. Excluding a scarce digital asset as
part of the core design is key to ensuring the network continues to be what it
is intended to be, a long-lived and economical public utility for Web identity.

## Good Governance

All blockchains have governance, whether implicit or explicit. The ability to
change the code may reside with miners, a handful of developers, or with those
that hold tokens(one token one vote).

The Veres One Project has opted to craft governance that is suitable for
governing a global public utility. To this end, the Veres One Project is a
mission-driven corporation managed by a Board of Governors that are not
financially tied to any other entities in the network, including Accelerators
or the Maintainer. The Board of Governors is also diverse in geography, gender,
and vocational background. Read more about the [Board of Governors](https://docs.veres.one/network/governors/) and Veres One [Governance](https://docs.veres.one/network/governance/)
