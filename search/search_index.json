            "text": "The Veres One Project\n\n\nThe Veres One Project envisions a world where people and organizations\ncontrol their identifiers and their identity data. The Veres One\nBlockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain optimized for identity on the\nWeb. The network ecosystem is designed to be self-sufficient through the\nuse of an innovative operational and funding model. The operational model\nensures openness, prevents attacks against the network, and financially\nrewards individuals and organizations that choose to run software to\nensure the security of the network. Human dignity demands that every\nindividual be able to participate equally in our increasingly digital\nsociety. That means everyone deserves the ability create and administer\nunique, globally resolvable identifiers. For that reason, the network is\nglobal and open to the public; anyone may participate.\n\n\nThe Problem\n\n\nTo date, every identifier you use online does not belong to you; it\nbelongs to someone else.\n\n\nThe Internet was not designed with interoperable identity systems in mind.\nThis inevitably forced websites to create their own solutions, which are\nnot interoperable.\n\n\nWhen you sign up to a website, you typically create a username and a\npassword. The website asks you for this information so that it can start\nto associate data with you. The more benevolent use of this data is to\ncustomize an experience suited to your needs. This identifier and data,\nhowever, are locked away on the site; they are not portable. Even the\nglobal identifiers that websites use, such as your email address, are not\nowned by you. The email address \"you@gmail.com\" isn\u2019t owned by you, it\u2019s\nowned by Google. You do not have control over your identifier nor your\ndata.\n\n\nSince this data is not portable, you must rebuild your identity\ninformation -- your identifiers and data -- from scratch on many different\nwebsites. Duplicating that information often means sharing more than\nintended, allowing websites to learn things and \ninfer \nthings about you\nthat you didn\u2019t expect.. It also means that each website accumulates toxic\ndata about you, inviting behavior like spam, financial fraud, data\nsiloing, data warehousing, and identity theft. Initiatives like the\nEuropean Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) only increase\nthe pressure to address these problems.\n\n\nIn addition to risks from the information we explicitly share with\nwebsites, there is also a vast amount of identity information already out\nthere, with few mechanisms for managing it. This outside information is\noften combined with the information we share to create surprisingly\ndetailed profiles, used for everything from ad targeting to site\ncustomization to custom pricing (not always for lower prices). The result\nis a strong economic incentive for large data warehousing companies to\nstore and sell your information, often without your consent.\n\n\nVision\n\n\nOur vision is to enable all people and organizations in the world to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate and own their online identifiers, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol their identity data and with whom they share that data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAchieving this vision will enable a Web where:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur identity information and identifiers are owned and controlled by\neach of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can more strongly prove  key attributes about our digital personas,\nreducing fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData can be bound to identifiers under our control instead of only to\nwebsites, or stuck on paper in file cabinets, improving data portability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy can be enhanced by choosing when and with whom our information\nis shared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData sharing can be more easily reduced to the minimum required for a\ngiven interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis vision is shared among a large community of people working within\nglobal organizations such as the Internet Identity Workshop, World Wide\nWeb Consortium, Internet Engineering Task Force, United Nations ID2020,\nand the Rebooting the Web of Trust project.\n\n\nMission\n\n\nThe mission of the Veres One Project is to facilitate the creation of\nsoftware and provide the ecosystem governance to enable anyone in the\nworld to create and manage their own decentralized identifiers.\n\n\nPotential applications include, but are not limited to portable\ncredentials for use in education, healthcare, government, trade, finance,\nand humanitarian efforts. Further information on application sectors can\nbe found in:\n\n/sectors/\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nTo achieve the vision stated above, the communities working on the problem\nhave identified a solution that is composed of three architectural\nlayers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized Identity Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifiable Credentials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized Identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foundational layer, Decentralized Identifiers, enables\nSelf-Administered Identifiers which means that any device, person, or\norganization in the world can create and control their own identifiers.\nDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are complementary to the Domain Name\nSystem (DNS) that is in widespread use today with one important\ndifference: with DNS you lease your identifiers instead of owning them,\nwhereas with DIDs, you own your identifiers.  The second layer, Verifiable\nCredentials, enables one to store and control one\u2019s digital credentials\nsuch as passports, drivers licenses, educational qualifications,\nprofessional licenses, and other third-party issued credentials. Finally,\nthe third layer is Decentralized Identity Management, which enables one to\ncontrol when, under what restrictions, and with whom their identity\ninformation, called a Verifiable Profile, is shared via software\napplications and digital wallets.\n\n\nWith Self-Administered Identifiers, such as DIDs, individuals can\nestablish independent, Verifiable Profiles, comprised of Verifiable\nCredentials from recognized authorities. For example, combining a subset\nof a college transcript with a proof of age from the Department of Motor\nVehicles to present to a prospective employer, both referring to the same\nDecentralized Identifier, either directly or indirectly. These Verifiable\nProfiles can be selectively shared with trusted parties, leveraging\nDecentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials to give individuals\ngreater control over our online identity.\n\n\nThe goal of the Veres One Project is to be a provider for the most\nfoundational piece of the vision: Decentralized Identifiers.\n\n\nThe Veres One Blockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain built\nspecifically for Decentralized Identifiers. This specialization enables\nthe blockchain to be faster, more cost effective, and more privacy\nenhancing compared to existing blockchains that are being repurposed for\nidentity management. The Veres One Ecosystem is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n - Anyone in the world may read and audit the entire contents\nof the ledger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissionless\n - Any person or organization in the world may create\nand control their identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaderless\n \n- Blockchain consensus relies on leaderless elector\ncollaboration, not proof of work, to determine when consensus has been\nfinalized. Electors are selected dynamically to allow participants to join\nand leave the network and to ensure that there is no centralization or\nsingle point of failure for the ledger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased entirely on open standards and open specifications \n- Broad\nimplementation and interoperability can only be achieved if all aspects of\nthe system are documented and standardized in a non-discriminatory,\npatent-free and royalty-free manner while ensuring that the creators and\nmaintainers of the system are properly funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt on a stakeholder driven governance model\n - The source code and\ndevelopment team have a strict mission-driven focus that always puts the\nusers of the ledger first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomically sustainable\n - The people that create, run, and protect\nthe network are paid by the Veres One Project to do so. Avoiding a\n\"tragedy of the commons\" is essential for sound network economics for a\nglobal public utility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-speculative\n - Unlike other ledgers, the Veres One Blockchain\ndoes not need a speculative network token or cryptocurrency, which\neliminates currency speculation, thus ensuring predictable long term\noperational costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nThe Veres One ecosystem consists of a number of roles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBoard of Governors\n is responsible for governance. This includes\nensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Project mission and\nmanaging, collecting, and distributing funds according to the funding\nmodel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nMaintainer\n is responsible for maintaining the Veres One software\nincluding continuous security review, managing community contributions,\ncorrecting software defects, and implementing new features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodes\n are responsible for providing computational and storage\nresources for the Network. As the system is permissionless, any person or\norganization may run one or more Nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNetwork\n is a collection of Nodes that maintain the decentralized\nledger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntities\n (people, organizations, and devices) use the Network to\ncreate and update decentralized identifiers and their associated\nmetadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerators\n enable entities to increase the speed at which Entities\ncan create and update identifiers on the Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntities may use the Veres One Network to create decentralized identifiers\nvia software applications such as digital wallets. There are two\nmechanisms for creating Decentralized Identifiers on the Network. Both\nmechanisms require roughly $1 USD to perform, which is derived from the\nestimated cost of running the Network. Updates to the Decentralized\nIdentifier require roughly $0.25 USD to perform or between 2%-4% of what\nthe Accelerator charges to write a particular type of data to the\nblockchain, whichever is greater. The first approach is to pay an\nAccelerator to create a Decentralized Identifier, which happens as quickly\nas the Network can come to consensus (a few minutes).  The second\nmechanism is to submit a creation request to the Network with an\nassociated proof of work, which typically takes 6-9 hours for a software\napplication to generate. Once the Network verifies the proof of work and\ncomes to consensus, the Decentralized Identifier will be created.\n\n\nThe Veres One Project collects proceeds from Accelerators at agreed upon\nrates set by the Board of Governors and distributes the funds according to\ncurrent operational needs. Accelerators fees will be waived on a recurring\nbasis for a fixed number of humanitarian uses, such as providing portable\ndigital credentials to refugees for asylum-seeking purposes. Further\ninformation related to Use of Funds is outlined later in this document.\n\n\nDeployment\n\n\nThe Veres One Blockchain Testnet is available for immediate use with Node\nand Developer documentation published at\n\nhttps://veres.one/developers/\n. The live\nnetwork is slated for a Q1 2018 launch.\n\n\nTeam and Community\n\n\nOur passion to realize Self-Administered Identity is something we share\nwith a substantial and growing community. There is broad interest and\nactivity from a variety of very capable technologists. The strength of\nthis community is why these efforts will bear fruit.\n\n\nDigital Bazaar\n is the \nFounder\n, and\nis the company that created the Veres One Blockchain technology and has\nbeen spearheading work on payments, identity, and blockchain for the Web\nfor over 14 years. Manu Sporny, the CEO, and Dave Longley, the CTO, have\nco-invented numerous technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs),\nVerifiable Credentials, Linked Data Signatures, the Web Ledger protocol,\nJSON-LD, and a variety of other technologies broadly deployed by large\nmultinational organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Yandex, and the\nBBC. The organization is also under contract to the United States\nDepartment of Homeland Security to provide analysis of Blockchain\ntechnologies and standardize technologies that produce a competitive\nmarketplace for identity solutions. Self-Administered Identity is one\ncomponent of Digital Bazaar\u2019s vision for the next generation Web which\nensures that every person on the planet has global identities that they\ncontrol and has access to the global economy.\n\n\nBlockchain Architecture Services LLC \nis the initial \nMaintainer\n; a\nnew technology company that has been formed for the primary purpose of\ntechnological management and development of the Veres One software and\nnetwork. This organization is responsible for proper security reviews, new\nfeatures identified as critical to the proper operation of the network,\nand additional features that are supportive of the Veres One Mission.\nBlockchain Architecture Services LLC and Digital Bazaar will initially\nshare employees until the Maintainer team is fully staffed. Blockchain\nArchitecture Services LLC reports to the \nBoard of Governors\n.\n\n\nThe \nVeres One Project\n is operated under a non-profit organization (to\nbe announced) and houses the \nBoard of Governors\n, which is responsible\nfor ensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Mission, selecting the\n\nMaintainer\n, and managing, collecting, and distributing funds according\nto the funding model to organizations like\n\nSpec-Ops\n, who develop open standards and\nreference implementations as open source software.\n\n\nSince 2005, the \nInternet Identity\nWorkshop\n (IIW) has been the\nworld\u2019s leading innovation forum for concepts like Self-Administered\nIdentity.  A vision holder and catalytic workshop to make real the vision\nof an identity layer of the Internet that works for people. It continues\nto gather every six months to move the specifications and implementations\nof the vision forward.\n\n\nRebooting Web of Trust\n (RWOT) is a\ncommunity of technologists, cryptographers, philosophers, ethnographers,\nand other domain experts developing scientific papers, technology, and\nspecifications for Self-Administered Technology. The community has been\nfocused on refining Linked Data Signatures, Verifiable Credentials, and\nDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs).\n\n\nThe \nWorld Wide Web Consortium\n (W3C) creates the\nnext generation standards for the Web. Employees of \nDigital Bazaar\n\nhave been deeply involved in the creation of next generation Web standards\nover the past two decades. The Veres One Project will always strive to be\n100% compliant with the standards the Veres One Blockchain uses and will\nhelp create new standards where none exist via the W3C and other pertinent\nstandards organizations.\n\n\nFundraising and Use of Funds\n\n\nThe Veres One Blockchain software already exists, which eliminates the\nneed for a Token Pre-Sale, a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), or\nan Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to develop the network software. In\naddition, avoiding the burden of tens of millions of dollars or more in\ninvestor returns ensures that Veres One can launch with the minimal amount\nof ecosystem debt in order to drive ecosystem costs down as low as\npossible. As the network scales, the marginal cost of using the ledger is\nexpected to decrease even further.\n\n\nThe primary use of funds will be to ensure network stability for decades\nto come. The non-profit Veres One Project, which governs the Veres One\nBlockchain, will receive the bulk of the funds to pay for continued\nsoftware development and security reviews, incentivize nodes running the\nledger as well as for governance and administrative tasks. All funds\nallocation, other than for the Founder, will be at the discretion of the\nVeres One Project. The graph below is a suggested starting point.\n\n\nBlockchain Architecture Services LLC will have the initial software\nsupport contract to maintain and advance the Veres One Blockchain. A\nsignificant portion of funding will also be directed to open source, open\nstandards, and incubation efforts that support the development of\nSelf-Administered technology while the rest will be used to ensure global\nlegal compliance and support the growing community.\n\n\n\n\nThe Founder is capped at $25M USD per annum in the event that aggregate\nrevenues exceed $500M USD per annum.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\nThis document provides an initial summary of the Veres One Project.\nReaders that would like to learn more about this initiative may find the\nfollowing more detailed documentation and specifications useful:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized Identifier\nSpecification\n - The technical\nspecification for Decentralized Identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVeres One Testnet Website\n - The Veres One\nTestnet website used by software developers to test the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifiable Credentials\nSpecification\n - The technical\nspecification for W3C Verifiable Credentials, which use Decentralized\nIdentifiers and the Veres One Blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Administered Identity\nPrimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn introduction to Self-Administered identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRebooting the Web of Trust\n - The series\nof workshops that are incubating much of the work that led to the Veres\nOne Blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: The Veres One Project, including its affiliates, are not\noffering network tokens using a Token Pre-Sale, Simple Agreement for\nFuture Tokens (SAFT), an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), or any other\nspeculative token or cryptocurrency sale mechanism. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is a summary of the current and future developments of the Veres\nOne Blockchain.

Self-Administered Identity is one\ncomponent of Digital Bazaar\u2019s vision for the next generation Web which\nensures that every person on the planet has global identities that they\ncontrol and has access to the global economy.  Blockchain Architecture Services LLC  is the initial  Maintainer ; a\nnew technology company that has been formed for the primary purpose of\ntechnological management and development of the Veres One software and\nnetwork. This organization is responsible for proper security reviews, new\nfeatures identified as critical to the proper operation of the network,\nand additional features that are supportive of the Veres One Mission.\nBlockchain Architecture Services LLC and Digital Bazaar will initially\nshare employees until the Maintainer team is fully staffed. Blockchain\nArchitecture Services LLC reports to the  Board of Governors .  The  Veres One Project  is operated under a non-profit organization (to\nbe announced) and houses the  Board of Governors , which is responsible\nfor ensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Mission, selecting the Maintainer , and managing, collecting, and distributing funds according\nto the funding model to organizations like Spec-Ops , who develop open standards and\nreference implementations as open source software.  Since 2005, the  Internet Identity\nWorkshop  (IIW) has been the\nworld\u2019s leading innovation forum for concepts like Self-Administered\nIdentity.  A vision holder and catalytic workshop to make real the vision\nof an identity layer of the Internet that works for people. It continues\nto gather every six months to move the specifications and implementations\nof the vision forward.  Rebooting Web of Trust  (RWOT) is a\ncommunity of technologists, cryptographers, philosophers, ethnographers,\nand other domain experts developing scientific papers, technology, and\nspecifications for Self-Administered Technology. The community has been\nfocused on refining Linked Data Signatures, Verifiable Credentials, and\nDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs).  The  World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C) creates the\nnext generation standards for the Web. Employees of  Digital Bazaar \nhave been deeply involved in the creation of next generation Web standards\nover the past two decades. The Veres One Project will always strive to be\n100% compliant with the standards the Veres One Blockchain uses and will\nhelp create new standards where none exist via the W3C and other pertinent\nstandards organizations.",

Maintainer  - The Maintainer, currently Blockchain Architectural Services,\n   is funded to maintain the Veres One Software and ensure the proper technical\n   operation of the Network.  Veres One Project  - The Veres One Project is funded to support the Board\n   of Governors in  governing  the Veres One Network.\n   This includes all aspects of supporting communities that\n   positively contribute to the Veres One Mission, legal obligations, travel\n   and lodging, and investments in promising new technologies that would\n   further enable the Veres One Mission.  Open Source and Standards  - Since the Veres One Network depends on the\n   availability of non-discriminatory patent-free and royalty-free standards,\n   and because royalty-free licenses are a critical component of any public\n   network, a significant portion of Network revenue is set aside for projects\n   that fall into this category.  Founder  - Digital Bazaar is compensated for developing and releasing\n   all of the core technology, governance, trademarks, and launching the Network.",

At the\nsame time, we know of no widely used Open Source license that achieves the\ngoals above. We want to be able to be open while providing for our families,\ntherefore, we are making an initial attempt at such a license below by making\na single modification to the Terms and Conditions of the AGPLv3. We will be\nworking with open source advocates and lawyers to generalize the license below\nover the coming years.\n\n\n\n\nVeres One Community Software License\n\n\nVersion 1, January 1st, 2018\n\n\nBase Version Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \nhttps://fsf.org/\n\n\nModifications Copyright (C) 2018 Veres One Project\n\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nPreamble\n\n\nThe Veres One Community Software License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software. It is\nbased on the\n\nGNU Affero General Public License\n\nwith minor modifications to avoid the tragedy of the commons that affects\nmost open source software projects when large organizations repurpose\nthe open source software without remunerating the individuals that\ncreated and maintain the software.\n\n\nThis license enables any individual or organization to use and\nredistribute the software for the purposes it was intended for in a\nnon-discriminatory patent and royalty-free basis.\n\n\nThe license enables any individual or organization to modify and redistribute\nthe software for the purposes it was intended for in a non-discriminatory\npatent and royalty-free basis as long as they share all intellectual property\n(patents and copyright) to the modifications under the upstream project's\nlicense.\n\n\nThis license prohibits any individual or organization to profit from modified\ncopies of the software without first entering into a remuneration agreement\nwith the developers that created and maintain the software.\n\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 1 of the Veres One Open Software\nLicense.\n\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of\nthe earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n1. Source Code.\n\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of\na work.\n\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n\n\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under\n    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\n    to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n\ne) If you are modifying the project from its original\n    purpose and plan to profit either directly or indirectly, you must\n    enter a remuneration agreement with developers of this project\n    as well as all upstream projects that require a license to\n    modify, distribute, or run the software for a different purpose.\n\n\n\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n\n\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n    provided you inform other peers where the object code and\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\n\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n\"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n\n\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\n    or authors of the material; or\n\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n\n\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n\n8. Termination.\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n11. Patents.\n\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n\n13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your\nversion supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the\nCorresponding Source of your version by providing access to the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some\nstandard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This\nCorresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any\nwork covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is\nincorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n\nThe Veres One Project may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the Veres One Community Software License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the Veres One Open Software\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Veres One Project.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of the\nVeres One Community Software License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Veres One Project.\n\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the Veres One Community Software License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.",

To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy.

Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.

For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
